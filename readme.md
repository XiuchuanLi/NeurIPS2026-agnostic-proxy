All experiments are performed on an i9-13900F CPU. The total time cost is about 75 min.

## Usage

Install kerpy (a package adapted from https://github.com/oxcsml/kerpy)

```(bash)
cd kerpy
python setup.py develop
cd ..
```

Reproduce the results in Fig. 5, the time cost is about 25 min.

```(bash)
cd algorithm
python discrimination.py
cd ..
```

Reproduce the results of our algorithm in Fig. 7, the time cost is about 10 min.

```(bash)
cd algorithm
python estimation.py
cd ..
```

Reproduce the results of baselines (CM and GRICA) in Fig. 7 (the code is adapted from https://github.com/danieletramontano/Causal-Effect-Identification-in-LiNGAM-Models-with-Latent-Confounders), the time cost is about 40 min.

```(bash)
cd baseline
python cm.py
python grica.py
cd ..
```
